During this time, the blue paint used in his painting was primarily made from water and other mineral components. The blue hue created by this combination of elements has been an attractive attribute for many centuries. Over time, the use of different types of pigments to create a sky blue color evolved and developed, resulting in the vibrant shades we see today.","done":true,"done_reason":"stop","context":[529,29989,5205,29989,29958,13,3492,526,263,8444,319,29902,20255,29889,2,29871,13,29966,29989,1792,29989,29958,13,11008,338,278,14744,7254,29973,2,29871,13,29966,29989,465,22137,29989,29958,13,1576,14744,7254,2927,5491,14637,304,263,10296,310,11955,29892,1316,408,7254,322,7933,29892,607,10017,263,9560,322,3516,2634,593,22888,29872,2998,408,376,7912,7254,1213,450,2684,3978,310,445,1840,338,451,9186,2821,29892,541,372,338,13112,304,505,1063,19480,287,2645,278,21794,16343,17608,29872,3785,491,10545,7664,7347,12245,3543,1004,29877,29892,1058,23139,278,13834,376,1576,15981,12443,29873,24274,29908,297,29871,29896,29953,29906,29945,29889,7133,445,931,29892,278,7254,10675,1304,297,670,20413,471,7233,4115,29891,1754,515,4094,322,916,7903,1705,7117,29889,450,7254,22888,29872,2825,491,445,10296,310,3161,756,1063,385,13978,573,12421,747,1082,363,1784,21726,29889,6811,931,29892,278,671,310,1422,4072,310,2930,19422,29879,304,1653,263,14744,7254,2927,15220,1490,322,8906,29892,9819,297,278,3516,2634,593,528,3076,591,1074,9826,29889],"total_duration":9655370214,"load_duration":8423619,"prompt_eval_count":40,"prompt_eval_duration":24586000,"eval_count":161,"eval_duration":9575675000}
